  <h3>Where will I be picked up?</h3>

    If they don't want to pick you up, you can arrange a pickup location when we pass you the contact details.</h5>

  <h3>Do I need to pay for my ride?</h3>
  <h5>We do not encourage drivers to ask for a large amount of money from their passengers.
    However, they may ask for some gas money, which will still be cheaper than taking a bus or a taxi.</h5>
