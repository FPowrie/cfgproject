  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions<h1>

  <h3>How does this website work?</h3>
  <p>Simply enter the date and time when you would like to share a car, enter your contact details and we will get in touch with you as soon we find a matching driver or passengers!</p>

    <br>

  <h3>How do I know whether a ride is available?</h3>
  <p>As soon as we find a ride for you, we will email you and put you in contact with the person who you'll share a car with.</p>

    <br>

  <h3>Where will I be picked up?</h3>
  <p>When entering details, those giving a lift need to indicate whether they are happy to pick you up at your address.
    If they don't want to pick you up, you can arrange a pickup location when we pass you the contact details.</p>

    <br>

  <h3>Do I need to pay for my ride?</h3>
  <p>We do not encourage drivers to ask for a large amount of money from their passengers.
    However, they may ask for some gas money, which will still be cheaper than taking a bus or a taxi.</p>
